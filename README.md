- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @joaovpp, I have a bachelors degree in economics and work for a financial consulting firm, but I love coding.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in full stack web development with Python and Javascript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python for back-end (focus in Django) and Javascript, HTML and CSS for front-end.
